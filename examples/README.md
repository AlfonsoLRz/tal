# Examples

* `render-reconstruct`: Tutorial on (1) how to simulate a NLOS scene using tal, choosing parameters in the YAML file, and (2) how to use the implemented reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct the object hidden around the corner.
    * For step (1), check the `render-reconstruct/nlos-z/nlos-z.yaml` file.
    * For step (2), check the `render-reconstruct/reconstruct.ipynb` file.
    * You can find further documentation in the `tal render` and `tal reconstruct` sections of this repo's README.
* `old`: Undocumented examples/scenes which may not work now.
